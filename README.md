This repository contains a primitive web app which displays user stats for League of Legends players. Only a couple of hours went into making this.

Don't forget to update the LOL API key in /server/credentials.json as it's only valid for 24 hours! Without it we won't be able to make any queries. You can get a new key over here: https://developer.riotgames.com/
